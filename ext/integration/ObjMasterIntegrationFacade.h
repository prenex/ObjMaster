/**
 * Integration facade layer/dll/so for the ObjMaster library.
 *
 * Useful for managed language integration or C-language binding.
 * Originally written for providing C#/.NET mono integration to the Unity game engine.
 *
 * Tested with: VS 2015 + unity hololens preview 5.4.0f3 versions but can work as a simple C-binding.
 * For building, just create an empty DLL project and add objmaster sources with this.
